    Hello,<br />\r\nI am contacting you because I’m doing some research for a mental
    health &amp; wellness campaign I’m working on related to Coronavirus (Covid-19).
    I was checking out a page of your site here (https://bitshyd.news.blog/2020/03/02/month-in-review-february-2020/),
    so thought I should reach out. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have been featured in Yahoo,
    ADAA, TheMighty, AMHCA, GoodMenProject, ThriveGlobal, HealthComU, etc... and as
    a result, the mental health of families &amp; individuals is something I'm quite
    passionate about; especially as we deal with the Coronavirus globally. <br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nWith that said, I'm involved with an important project that is focused on
    educating people about mental health-related topics and most recently Covid-19
    by possibly working with sites like yours. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn short, I'm trying
    to find websites that are open to continuing to publish content on this very important
    topic even if it requires a sponsorship fee. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are interested
    in learning more about the project, please let me know. If not, I understand and
    don’t necessarily expect a response to my message here. Whatever you decide, thanks
    for your consideration &amp; time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarie<br /><br /><br /><hr
