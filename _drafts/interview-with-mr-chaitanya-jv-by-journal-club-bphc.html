<li><strong>From SU president then, to Tech Mahindra now, how did you choose between the options you had at every step?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I can’t say that the decisions were impulsive. It’s basically that at every point, my motive was to see if I can make any kind of positive impact. From my first semester, I was very clear about contesting in elections. Because there was great scope to create impact at that point of time. At Tech Mahindra now, I work with the Healthcare team, the Arogya Sethu app, and a portal for online medical services. I always make sure that I create an impact.</p>

<li><strong>During your study at BITS Hyd, Did you ever worry where you would land after this?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I was never worried because I always knew what I wanted to do. I had a few things in my mind which I really wanted to do at some point of time. That might be too optimistic but I never had doubts about it. I did not even sit for the campus placements, because I already interned with one of our alums from Pilani. I really liked the start-up focussed environment there. And I just went ahead with it. I did not even think about the placements. That is probably something everyone can try, to look forward to what you want to do, when you are lost or confused.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>You were the first president who organized Pearl. All of us are really disappointed now as our pearl was cancelled. So we want to hear more about Pearl. How did this name come and how did you feel being the first president organizing it?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first Pearl was in 2008 and it was an Intra-college fest. The student activities head wanted us to come up with a name. So, we put up a poll with the names we thought of, and, (<strong>Do you remember the other names as well ?</strong>) all of them were in line with Hyderabad, I don’t really remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There was a poll again the next year, when some people wanted to change it. But I made sure they did not change the name. <strong>(It is still Pearl now). </strong>Yes, it is still Pearl now.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} --></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>The buzz after the latest announcement about your wedding is huge. There were multiple polls and memes. Anything that you would want to share about this or Niharika ma’am?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ummm, I mean, I never imagined that I will find a perfect balance in my partner I am looking for. I found the balance in her and that is how I made my call. Yeah.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":5} --></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Afaik, you had a dream CV for yourself, everything being well planned. Most of the students are still not clear or planned including me tbh ;). What is your advice on this?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is just the flow. But thinking five years ahead is a good way .A lot of things change, especially in the current generation. It is better to have a five year roadmap ahead. More than that I don’t think it is necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":6} --></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>For the guys of BPHC, How to marry an actress? xD.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is not the actress, to be frank it can be anyone. One can even marry the daughter of the president of the United States. You just have to cross paths with them at the right time and in the right moment. I just think it was destined and it happened yeah. ;)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":7} --></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>You were an UPSC aspirant if i’m not wrong. Tell us something about it. How did ISB come into picture after that?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As I said, I keep having things that I want to do. My dad is an IPS officer. It was in my mind and I always wanted to give it a shot. It intensified but somewhere down the line I felt that profession doesn’t fit me. I constantly need change in the profession. Of course, being a bureaucrat is extremely challenging. And I felt that it was not the right decision for me for the commitment it needs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I always wanted to be an entrepreneur and I also made a couple of small investments in startups. That's when I joined KPMG as a public safety consultant and the shift to MBA came into picture.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":8} --></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>As a president, was there any change you desperately wanted to see on campus? Were there any long time goals?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There was one thing I always thought about. How differently are you doing the fest and what kind of positive impact are you sending out? That is when I made a proposition to the general body about the business adoption programme for Pearl where we spend 20% of the sponsorship towards adopting a village. Also appoint another StuCCAn for this and make this a year long process. This being a constant investment cycle. This was in my mind at that time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":9} --></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Niha ma’am was cleverly giving hints on insta, Did any of the memes make you laugh?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yeah, I really liked one meme of Venkatesh and Sunil, from Nuvvu Naaku Nachav where the hero sarcastically says that the comedian is taking his problem way too seriously than him. They put me into Venkatesh.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":10} --></p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Are you a Moviebuff?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes. Pre-covid, I used to randomly pick a movie on a Sunday with a frequency of one in ten days.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":11} --></p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>Here’s the typical BITSian question. Tell us about your attendance, CG, and how ‘lite’ you were?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The word lite was probably rediscovered after me. My attendance was in single digits and my CG was around 6.5 ! <strong>(Do you remember your ID?) </strong>Ummm.. Ummmm.. No! xD. But I still have my ID cards with me, the normal one and the SU one.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":12} --></p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>One thing that you missed when you left the college?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The freedom that the campus gave.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Are you guys still living with snakes? I almost stepped on one near the rocks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":13} --></p>
<ol start="13">
<li><strong>When was the last time you visited the campus and when are you coming back again?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It was in 2015 and it’s been a while. Maybe this year. I think I am supposed to be there for the 10 year reunion. I hope I’ll meet you guys soon.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":14} --></p>
<ol start="14">
<li><strong>Finally, what message would you want to leave to your juniors on campus sir?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>BITS gives you a lot of freedom. It is all about how you manage it, the freedom the campus gives. And when you are not able to balance it, use the freedom to build your character. I have seen students who balance their academics but waste the rest of their time and it does not add up to what you are as a person. Use that extra time and freedom to build your personality. The four years on campus is what made me who I am now. Be it my confidence levels,&nbsp; the way I can talk to, convince people, the maturity in my thought process.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’ll hopefully see you guys soon on campus. It was really nice cherishing my memories about BITS.&nbsp;</p>
