<p>On 12th December 2019, the entire world watched as the Indian Parliament passed the Citizen Amendment Act with a majority vote of 125 to 105. When passed into law, this proposal would not allow immigrants of Muslim ethnicity to gain citizenship status. To the observers of this event, one thing had become apparent. The idealized concept of ‘Hindutva,’ which had seemed like a harmless and passing afterthought yesterday, was turning into a reality in front of their very own eyes. Outcries of protest began both abroad and at home with the United Nations calling the act “fundamentally discriminatory in nature”<a href="https://thewire.in/rights/united-nations-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-cab"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and the United States going as far as to call for sanctions against Amit Shah and the leaders of the government<sup><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/federal-us-commission-seeks-sanctions-against-amit-shah-if-cab-passed-in-parliament-1626880-2019-12-10">[2]</a></sup>. The fiasco set into a motion what some would call the “hidden agenda” that the NDA had nurtured in its ranks since coming to power. This ‘plan’ was now finally brought into the light, not by force or propaganda, but in the deceptive form of a legally established law.</p>

<p>In recent years, the religious divide in India has not only widened on the legislative front but also on the social one. Since the start of 2014, India has seen a steady increase in violence pertaining to religious differences. The National Minority Commission reports more than a hundred hate crimes against Christians every year<sup><a href="http://ncm.nic.in/homepage/complaints_yearly.php">[3]</a></sup>, but the believed number is supposed to be much higher as many victims do not file an FIR due to fear of being attacked again. Non-governmental organizations put the number of cases at 177 in 2015, doubling to 300 in 2016<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180910153755/http://www.worldea.org/news/4651/evangelical-fellowship-of-india-persecution-report-2015">[4]</a></sup> and mounting to 527 in a single year in 2019<sup><a href="https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/on-narendra-modi-watch-steep-rise-in-crime-against-christians-between-2016-and-2019">[5]</a></sup>. The USCIRF degraded India to a “country of particular concern” in 2020<sup><a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/countries">[6]</a></sup>, a place it shares with China, North Korea and Pakistan. India rose to the 15th place in persecution, from the 31st<sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/11/christians-in-india-increasingly-under-attack-study-shows">[7]</a></sup>. 97% of the cases under Cow Vigilantism have been registered under Modi Administration, the victims in these cases are 84% Muslim<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170928175631/http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/86-dead-in-cow-related-violence-since-2010-are-muslim-97-attacks-after-2014-2014">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A common link that many of these cases have is the involvement of “Saffron Organizations” such as Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and its youth-wing - the Bajrang Dal. The VHP is a right-wing organization that has played a part in violence pertaining to minorities, advocating Hindu Supremacy and also raising inflammatory slogans such as <em>“Pehle Kasai, Phir Isai.”</em> (First Muslims, then Christians). In a VHP meeting in 2019, the presiding host even admitted that NRC and CAA were going to be used to further the concept of Hindutva<sup><a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/cover-story/article29498517.ece">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Over the course of its reign from 2014 to 2019, the BJP has not issued any particular interest to curtail and compromise the working of these organizations. Instead, since 2014 they have been fighting a war against an invisible and mythical enemy. A ghost that has no proof of existence but has still managed to resurge in new forms. Let’s go to where the story begins - the BJP’s campaign against Love Jihad.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="love-jihad-a-fabricated-conspiracy">Love Jihad - A Fabricated Conspiracy</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The CAA isn’t the first time the Bhartiya Janata Party has come under fire for introducing laws that seem unreasonable against the minority. The start of their reign in 2014 included the revival of the accusation popularly known as “Love Jihad.” At the forefront of this controversy was a BJP MP contesting from Gorakhpur named Ajay Singh Bisht. The Chief Minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh. He is also known by his more popular name - Yogi Adityanath. In 2014, Adityanath started talking about what he considered was an “international conspiracy” to convert Hindu girls through marriage to Muslim men. He stated that this was an organized operation that threatened the safety of girls in Uttar Pradesh. In response to these claims, the Allahabad High Court issued an order to restrain the use of the word and a warning to Adityanath<sup><a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/love-jihad-high-court-up-govt-ec-pil-yogi-adityanath-41383.html?ref=veng">[10]</a></sup>. Further, the UP police refuted these accusations saying that these terms had only been coined to “create fear and divide society.”<sup><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/In-UP-community-bans-mobiles-for-girls-to-fight-love-jihad/articleshow/41472311.cms">[11]</a> </sup>However, fears of a deep rooted conspiracy continued to spread in the states of Jharkhand, Maharashtra, and Kerala.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In 2017, an NIA (National Investigating Agency) probe revealed a case in Kerala where a girl named Hadiya had been in contact with members of the PFI at the time of her conversion. Popular Front of India or PFI is an extreme right-wing Islamic group that has been involved in many attacks on non-Muslim groups over the years. Indian reporters claimed to have even made one of the PFI’s leaders admit to carrying out forced conversions on camera. Controversy erupted across the country as the NIA submitted the report accusing the PFI of involvement to the Supreme Court. However, the court ruled that Hadiya’s conversion and marriage to a Muslim were not forced and were done with her consent<sup><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/hadiya-s-marriage-to-shefin-stays-supreme-court-overturns-kerala-high-court-order-1184561-2018-03-08">[12]</a></sup>. The judges further stated that Hadiya had said that she was practicing Islam for close to one year before she met her husband. Throughout this, the NIA’s stand was adamant and claimed that there were over 90 cases of forced conversions across the entire state of Kerala. At the behest of these requests, the Supreme Court ordered the NIA to continue its investigation into these suspected cases if it saw fit.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For one year, the NIA investigated these cross-religion marriages in Kerala and finally concluded that it had “not found any evidence to suggest that any of the participants in the marriages were coerced.”<sup><a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-ends-kerala-probe-says-there-s-love-but-no-jihad/story-wlpWR7BMNcdJHkb1MUso4J.html">[13]</a></sup> The NIA added that many of the subjects in the cases had been in contact with members of the PFI. However, no evidence was found to indicate that PFI forced conversions upon these people.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Over the course of 12 years, three specific government probes and even an SIT have been ordered to give some substance to the conspiracy of “Love Jihad.” In these twelve years, no incriminating evidence has been found that advocated any organized attempt at forced conversions<sup><a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-ends-kerala-probe-says-there-s-love-but-no-jihad/story-wlpWR7BMNcdJHkb1MUso4J.html">[13]</a><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/Karnataka-CID-finds-no-evidence-of-Love-Jihad/article16891851.ece">[14]</a><a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2017/09/30/india-is-working-itself-into-a-frenzy-about-interfaith-marriages">[15]</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121006062249/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/kerala-cops-fail-to-establish-love-jihad-conspiracy/107581-3.html">[16]</a><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-no-credible-evidence-love-jihad-cases-in-kanpur-crumble-2321766">[17]</a></sup>. However, public sentiment demanding a law continued to grow, motivated by the words of those in power. The final blow came on 26 October 2020 when Nikita Tomar, a Hindu girl, was gunned down outside her college by a Muslim boy who wanted her to convert and marry him against her wish<sup><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/faridabad-love-jihad-shooting-video-protests-hindu-muslim-cctv-b1370135.html">[18]</a></sup>. Before proceeding, the writers wish to convey their solidarity for the victim of this gruesome attack. We by no means support or justify this kind of action. Soon after Nikita’s death, protests began in Haryana that turned violent, resulting in the injuries of about ten police officers<sup><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/10-policemen-injured-in-ballabgarh-violence/article32999584.ece">[19]</a></sup>. Meanwhile, in the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh protests, the police found that “inflammatory messages were responsible for instigating violence.”<sup><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/nikita-tomar-murder-protests-whatsapp-groups-6931459/">[20]</a></sup> Right-wing groups took this opportunity to retaliate, calling for a law now more than ever. A Special Investigation Team was launched to assess the gravity of the situation. The investigation crumbled, citing that it had found no evidence of forced conversions in the marriages they looked into in the state<sup><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-no-credible-evidence-love-jihad-cases-in-kanpur-crumble-2321766">[17]</a></sup>. Ignoring official reports and surveys, in November 2020 Adityanath’s government passed the “anti-conversion” law. The law focused on “unlawful” religious conversions that can be brought about by marriage or coercion and offered a jail term of up to ten years.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In over 15 months of the law’s existence, 65 cases have been registered in Madhya Pradesh and 108 in Uttar Pradesh. In MP, 36 are undergoing trial, but 29 haven’t even had charges pressed against them, and there have been zero verdicts up till this point. The story in UP is quite the same; 11 cases have already been closed due to lack of evidence, 24 are still undergoing investigation, and 79 are currently on trial. Many of the cases have been filed by family members, acquaintances, and right-wing extremist groups where the “victim” has rubbished the accusations and claimed that she converted of her own consent. Organizations such as the Bajrang Dal have either themselves approached the police or pressured the girls' families to press charges against the accused. In one case where the involvement of external organizations is suspected, the girl who filed the case skipped three court hearings in a row<sup><a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heartbreak-wasted-policing-injustice-love-jihad-law-fuels-hate-101641752363076.html">[21]</a></sup>. In another, one month after pressing charges, the girl wanted to withdraw the lawsuit but couldn’t because the sections of the law were non-compoundable. In Uttar Pradesh, a pregnant woman was placed under police protection against her wishes while she vehemently protested that she had married out of her own free will. She suffered complications in custody and had a miscarriage soon after<sup><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/up-love-jihad-law-moradabad-woman-miscarriage-husband-released-from-jail-1751190-2020-12-19">[22]</a></sup>. One girl was so shocked that her mother had filed a police complaint and that her marriage was being investigated that she told a reporter<sup>[17]</sup></p>

<p>While the Love Jihad law was causing problems for the Muslim community in the north, things were about to get very difficult for India’s second-largest minority - Christians.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The introduction of the anti-conversion law in some states with a high Christian populace could negatively affect missionaries doing relief work and Christian leaders in those areas. As far back as July of 2021, the Karnatakan government began issuing surveys into mapping the Christian population<sup><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/karnataka-churches-survey-controversy-7594494/">[23]</a></sup>. But by October, it seems the flames of paranoia had breached through the doorsteps of the state legislation. Soon, the surveys were instructed to identify “unauthorized” missionary work and “forced conversions.”<sup><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/karnataka-assembly-panel-to-order-survey-on-christian-missionary-work-7574115/">[24]</a></sup> Allegations began to be made in the assembly by politicians who claimed that mass conversions had taken place in their constituencies. No data was shown to back this up. At the start of December, the surveys were called off after no evidence was found that indicated “forced conversions.”<sup><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/conversions-not-forced-karnataka-calls-off-survey/articleshow/88018339.cms">[25]</a></sup> <em><strong>Despite this,</strong></em> the cries from the BJP politicians did not die down.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Throughout 2021 the situation on the ground worsened. Christian churches and prayer meetings were attacked, in-session, by Hindutva groups which sometimes had assistance from the police. By November, 39 incidents of violence had been reported<sup><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/39-attacks-on-christians-in-karnataka-this-year-pucl-report/article37956603.ece">[26]</a></sup>. Most of these attacks included storming private property and assaulting congregation members, especially the leaders. The main perpetrators were young - violent, reckless, and misled. On 23rd December 2021, despite mounting pressure, the state legislature passed the anti-conversion law two days before Christmas. When the 25th came, a gathering at a school in Pandavapura in Karnataka was disrupted by right-wing activists<sup><a href="https://scroll.in/latest/1013644/hindutva-group-allegedly-disrupts-christmas-celebrations-in-a-school-in-karnataka">[27]</a></sup>. The organizing nuns were told to stop “forced religious conversions” and cease from celebrating Christmas. There were six disruptions on the same day in multiple parts of the country - two of which involved violence<sup><a href="https://scroll.in/article/1014007/three-christmas-season-attacks-in-india-where-the-police-failed-to-act-against-hindutva-mobs#:~:text=The Christmas attacks are part,harassment against Christians in 2021">[28]</a><a href="https://scroll.in/article/1014007/three-christmas-season-attacks-in-india-where-the-police-failed-to-act-against-hindutva-mobs#:~:text=The%20Christmas%20attacks%20are%20part,harassment%20against%20Christians%20in%202021.)$$%5B%5E%7B%5B29%5D">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The instigators were either Hindutva ideologists and Bajrang Dal or VHP members.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Many claim that the anti-conversion law has unreasonable measures that make it easy to exploit. It is entirely possible to file a case under the law without the presence of any evidence. This is because the law puts the “burden of proof” on the accused to prove whether he is innocent or not. Further, the presence of a victim is not a requirement, meaning that anyone who is related to the victim or is a “colleague” can file a case even without the “victim’s” permission.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not only that, people have to seek permission from the state to convert legally under the law. The convertee and converter must submit two forms at least thirty days in advance to a government office. These forms with names and public details will be put up on a public notice board for <em><strong>anyone</strong></em> to “object” for thirty days. If a complaint is recorded during this period, it will be immediately investigated. After conversion, the convertee has to submit another form that will be put up for another thirty days to call for objections. Failure to do so will result in imprisonment ranging from one to five years for the convertee and converter. In UP, the first form should be submitted 60 days in advance instead of 30. This translates to it taking a minimum period of 60 days (90 in UP), where your personal information would be on public display, for you to change your religion by consent. In comparison, you could change your name twice during this period and thrice if you live in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="as-it-stands">As it stands...</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>International response to the drop in religious freedom have been critical. For the anti-conversion law, the USCIRF stated that such measures “create a hostile, and on occasion violent, environment for religious minority communities because they do not require any evidence to support accusations of wrongdoing.”<a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/India.2017.pdf"><sup>[30]</sup></a> They also list certain instances where the law was misused to restrict religious freedom. Statistical data has detailed that most of arrests made under the new regulations are people from minority communities<sup>[21]</sup>. The sudden rise in cases and incidents right after the law was introduced indicates that some groups may use the law to target specific ethnic communities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to questions, one body that must be called into scrutiny is the government enacted these laws. Here at the Journal Club, we would like to ask some key questions that we think deserve some answers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Why did the governments in UP and Karnataka go ahead with the law while ignoring reports made just days before that showed no evidence of forced conversions?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the face of declining minority safety, why does the government introduce laws detrimental to these groups instead of trying to protect them? Why has forced conversion (which has little to no proof) become such an essential agenda for BJP-ruled states?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Why do groups like the Bajrang Dal and VHP actively participate in vandalism and disruptions across the country, but there are no parliamentary discussions on curbing their freedom?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The rise in belligerent activities since the BJP rule started in 2014 emphasizes a strong point. This club by no means says that BJP finances or plans violent activities. But by backing discriminate laws like CAA and Anti-conversion and promoting the ‘Hindutva’ ideology, the government has given extremist groups something much more valuable than money and guns.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It has given them confidence.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The most dangerous thing you can give a man.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Confidence - that makes the vandals feel that it's okay to be this way. Encouragement - that they’re on the side of good. Justification - that their illegal acts only further the concept of ‘Hindutva.’</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To conclude, the rise in minority assaults and hostile nature of laws have posed serious questions about where the priorities of the government lies. Will the BJP decide to turn their attention to these issues in the future? Only time will tell, but to quote old man Job in the Bible,</p>
