<p>The quarantine can get really boring and you must most definitely be looking for productive ways to spend your time. We at Journal Club have compiled a list of online courses that you could try out to learn something new and explore some interesting fields of study.</p>

<p>Machine learning comprises a study of algorithms that help the system perform certain tasks without having to be programmed with explicit instructions. These systems purely rely on patterns and inferences.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An introductory course to Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng, one of the pioneers in the field. The course starts from the very basics of the field such as Regression algorithms and builds up to advanced algorithms such as Neural Networks. The only possible downside to this course is that the assignments are to be done in MATLAB/ OCTAVE, this is quite redundant and outdated because most of the Machine Learning practitioners have shifted to Python.</p>

<p>Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which mainly focuses on neural networks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This five-course specialization takes you through the various aspects of understanding a neural network and the different varieties in it. With the mini-projects that are part of the course, you learn to build some really interesting applications such as cat vs. dog classifiers to analyze sequence and time-series data.</p>

<p>Reinforcement Learning also comes under the broader umbrella of machine learning but in this field, the notion of a reward is introduced. The system in any given environment has to work in such a way that it optimizes the reward. This is modelled in a similar fashion in which little kids are taught.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is one of the most edge fields of Machine Learning. This course assumes that you have some prior knowledge in the field and builds on top of that. The course is well structured with equal parts of theory and practical coding practice. It is the best way to enter the field of Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p>Codeacademy is one of the best places to learn a new programming language. It’s easy to navigate the user interface and tests at the end of every lesson help you learn with ease. They offer a course in Python 3, you can check that out<strong> <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3">here</a></strong>. The course starts from scratch, it assumes that the student has no prior coding knowledge.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It teaches the basics of the language such as the syntax and the common data structures, slowly builds up to functions and classes. This also covers a lot of important concepts from the object-oriented programming paradigm.</p>

<h3><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What is imperative when it comes to knowledge in data structures and algorithms is the numbers of questions that you have practised, not the certifications or the courses that you have completed. A good place to start would be<strong> <a href="https://codeforces.com/">here</a></strong>. Start with problems labelled A and once you have gained enough experience, move on to problems of higher difficulty such as B and later on C.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is also important to focus on the theory to be able to solve questions with ease.</p>

Some parts of the course also involve concepts from Classical Mechanics which can be learnt as the course proceeds. It is a 60-lecture playlist, available both on the NPTEL website and YouTube.<br />(Highly recommended for Mechanical Engineering students who are seeking an entry point into CFD studies)</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to Aerodynamics:</strong><br />1. <strong>Aerodynamics: LearnCAx- </strong>The course introduces you to the basic concepts in aerodynamics, with some integration of CFD in the last module. Good course for beginners who are looking to get a feel of the subject.<br />2. <strong>Introduction to Aerodynamics: EdX-</strong> Offered by MITX  (David Darmofal)- An analogous to the MIT 16.100 course physically thought at the undergraduate level, this course has a similar structure to its alternative mentioned above. A medium effort course, this course also helps introduce one to the basic concepts in aerodynamics.</li>

<p>Leonard Suskind is the founding director of the <strong>Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics.</strong> He has been one of the pioneering personalities in theoretical physics and this series of 10 videos of approximately 2 hours each intends to introduce you to all the basic concepts involved in Particle Physics. It is a fairly long course and may not suit casual learners’ interests. However, if you are further interested in the topic after the completion of courses, you may watch 10 more lectures of</p>
<p><em>New Revolutions in Particle Physics: Standard Model<br /></em>which is a continuation of the Basic Concepts playlist.</li>

<p>If you are interested to further pursue the subject after the completion of this course, there are two courses that succeed this course, Quantum Mechanics II and Quantum Mechanics III.  QM III, unfortunately, does not have video lectures, but lecture notes and assignments are available on the OCW website.</li>
<li><strong>Leonard Suskind: All Stanford Physics Lectures in Order: YouTube<br /></strong>Offered By: Stanford;  Instructor: Leonard Suskind
<p>This comprehensive playlist would help you gain a fairly thorough understanding of Quantum Physics. The course takes you through Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, Particle Physics, String Theory and everything in between. Look out for the playlist posted by ‘Chaz K. Shand’ as a brief break-up of the modules is given in the description of his playlist. You can then choose to selectively complete the topics of your interest. The above listed two particle physics playlists are also a part of this master playlist.</li>
